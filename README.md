# Notes
I'm just learning about audio, DSP and data over sound. 

This is just my first attempt to apply what I'm studying

# Play
To play you need to use ffmpeg and this command: ffplay -f f32le -ar  44100 -showmode 1 out.bin

I don't know how to code an audio decoder, but I'll learn how to make one
